🛍️ Customer Segmentation in a Mall
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers in a shopping mall based on their purchasing behavior and demographic details.
Using clustering techniques, we identify distinct customer groups so that the mall can target them with personalized marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and increase sales.

🎯 Objective
The main objective is to group customers into segments based on:

1. Annual Income

2. Spending Score

3. Age

These segments help businesses:

a. Tailor marketing campaigns for specific groups.

b. Design personalized offers and loyalty programs.

c. Understand customer behavior patterns.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning (K-Means clustering)

Jupyter/Kaggle Notebook – Implementation

📊 Methodology
Data Collection – Used a publicly available dataset containing mall customer details.

Data Preprocessing – Handled missing values, selected relevant features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized patterns in spending and income.

Clustering (K-Means) – Applied the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters and grouped customers accordingly.

Visualization – Plotted clusters for better understanding.

📈 Key Insights
Customers can be grouped into distinct spending and income categories.

High-income, high-spending customers form a premium segment for targeted offers.

Low-income, low-spending customers may require different engagement strategies.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is Mall Customers Dataset, commonly available in public ML repositories such as Kaggle.
